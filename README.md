# PLEMA: Prompt Lung Examination via Machine Automation for Tuberculosis

## Overview

PLEMA (**Pathogen Locator Evaluation for Mycobacterium Analysis**) is a research-driven system designed to assist in the **early detection of Tuberculosis (TB)**.  
By integrating **robotics, digital microscopy, and AI-powered analysis (YOLO via Roboflow)**, PLEMA enhances diagnostic accuracy, reduces manual errors, and accelerates TB detection in both clinical and low-resource settings.

This repository documents the development of PLEMA, from research foundations to implementation and testing.

## Abstract

In Kidapawan City, one of the most pressing health concerns is **tuberculosis (TB)**, a life-threatening disease caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)_.  
Traditional diagnostic procedures remain highly manual, which introduces delays, increases human error, and reduces efficiency.  
**PLEMA (Pathogen Locator Evaluation for Mycobacterium Analysis)** addresses these challenges through an **automated robotic platform** for sputum smear microscopy, integrated with **AI-powered YOLO detection models trained via Roboflow**.  
By combining affordable hardware (ESP32, digital microscope, optics) with AI-based analysis, PLEMA is designed to provide a **scalable, accurate, and accessible TB diagnostic tool**.

## Objectives

- Automate sputum smear microscopy for TB diagnosis.
- Compare PLEMA‚Äôs diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with traditional microscopy.
- Evaluate cost-effectiveness of AI-powered microscopy vs. existing methods.
- Provide a **scalable solution** for under-resourced healthcare settings.

## Methodology

- **Hardware:** ESP32 microcontroller, SVBONY SV109 digital microscope, 100√ó oil immersion objective lens, condenser, LED light source, 3D-printed chassis, automated XY stage.
- **Software:** AI-powered detection pipeline using **YOLO models trained via Roboflow**.
- **Treatments:**
  - Treatment 1 ‚Äì 5 mL spot sputum
  - Treatment 2 ‚Äì 5 mL early-morning sputum
  - Treatment 3 ‚Äì 5 mL second spot sputum
  - **Control:** Standard diagnostic method

Results will be validated by comparing automated system outputs with human laboratory technologist analysis.
